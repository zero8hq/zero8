# Micro-Phase 4: Core Job Scheduling

This micro-phase focuses on implementing the core job scheduling features of the ZER08 project. Each step is designed to build upon the previous one, ensuring a logical progression and a clear understanding of the tasks involved.

## Step 1: Database Schema for Jobs
- **Action**: Create the `jobs` table in Supabase.
- **Details**: Use the following schema:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE jobs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE,
    trigger_timings TEXT[] NOT NULL,
    freq TEXT NOT NULL,
    rule_type TEXT,
    rule_value JSONB,
    override_dates DATE[],
    callback_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
    last_triggered TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    call_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0  -- New column to track the number of times the job is called
  );
  ```
- **Dependency**: Ensure the `users` table is already created.

## Step 2: Job Creation API
- **Action**: Implement the `POST /api/schedule` endpoint.
- **Details**:
  - Validate input data.
  - Parse scheduling logic.
  - Store job details in the `jobs` table.
- **Dependency**: Completion of Step 1.

## Step 3: Job Management APIs
- **Action**: Implement the following endpoints:
  - `GET /api/jobs`: List all jobs for the authenticated user.
  - `GET /api/job/:id`: Fetch details of a specific job.
  - `PATCH /api/job/:id`: Update job details or status.
  - `DELETE /api/job/:id`: Delete a specific job.
- **Details**:
  - Ensure authentication and authorization checks.
  - Validate user permissions for each job action.
- **Dependency**: Completion of Step 2.

## Step 4: Job Management UI
- **Action**: Develop the user interface for job management.
- **Details**:
  - Create a form for job creation.
  - Implement views for job listing and job details.
  - Develop interfaces for editing and deleting jobs.
- **Dependency**: Completion of Step 3.

## Step 5: Testing and Validation
- **Action**: Conduct thorough testing of all implemented features.
- **Details**:
  - Test API endpoints for correct functionality and error handling.
  - Validate UI components for usability and responsiveness.
  - Ensure data integrity and security measures are in place.
- **Dependency**: Completion of Steps 1-4.

Each step in this micro-phase should be completed and verified before proceeding to the next, ensuring a stable and functional job scheduling system.
